# SVM Parameter Optimization Assignment UCS654

## Project Title
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Parameter Optimization Using GridSearchCV

## Dataset
The dataset used in this assignment includes a classification problem where the target variable is `quality`. The features are preprocessed using `StandardScaler` for normalization.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   * The dataset is loaded using `pandas`.
   * The target variable is separated from the feature set.
   * Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` to improve model performance.
2. **Model Selection**
   * A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier is selected from `sklearn.svm`.
3. **Parameter Optimization**
   * A **GridSearchCV** is used to perform hyperparameter tuning over a specified parameter grid (e.g., `C`, `gamma`, and `kernel`).
   * Cross-validation is used to ensure the generalizability of the model.
4. **Model Evaluation**
   * Accuracy score is used as the primary performance metric.
   * Additional visualizations (like count plots) are created using `seaborn` to explore class distributions.

## Results
The results are summarized in a structured format, showing performance metrics for each parameter combination. The best parameter set is selected based on the highest cross-validated accuracy.
